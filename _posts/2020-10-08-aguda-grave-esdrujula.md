# Aguda, Grave, Esdrújula

In Spanish there are many accent rules. Some are easy to decipher in context, while others require an esoteric mathematical formula to understand. The goal of this blog post is to demystify the toughest accent rules because, as mysterious as they may be, they’re not hard to learn. As a kid, I grew up speaking English and Spanish, but I hadn’t studied Spanish in school. One day, when I was at the beach with family, my aunt, (a former school teacher), sat down with me and taught me the three magic accent rules: aguda, llana (grave), y esdrújula. She taught me this lesson and tested me on it several times throughout the day. In the course of one afternoon, I was able to learn my accents, and it changed my life. It permitted me to write essays while attending university in Caracas. It’s also the reason I’ve been able to work as an interpreter for over ten years. This is why I like to tell parents to teach these accent rules to their children––it will greatly improve their Spanish spelling and boost their confidence.

If you count the words in a Spanish dictionary, you may find about 190K words, 50K of them with written accents. Of course, this depends on the dictionary. Language is not an exact science, but I believe that when you learn these three rules that you can improve your spelling proficiency in Spanish by 26% or more.

First and foremost, you should be able to hear which syllable is being stressed. Aguda words are stressed on the last syllable, grave words are stressed on the penultimate syllable, and esdrújula words are stressed before the penultimate syllable (e.g. papel, puerta, anónimo, respectively). Once you can make out which syllable is being stressed, you can start to learn whether to mark the word with an acute accent ( ´ ) or not.

The Three Magic Rules

## Aguda:

If a word is stressed at the last syllable, you only write the acute accent when it ends in ‘n’, ‘s’ or a vowel (palabra aguda). For instance:. constitución, habló, interés. Words that end in other letters are not marked with an accent (e.g. papel, correr, feliz).


## Grave (Llana):

This category follows a logic that is opposite to that of aguda. Only words that don’t end in a vowel, ‘s’, or ‘n’ are marked with an accent when the second to last syllable is stressed (e.g. fácil, lápiz, béisbol, encanto, mañana, presentimiento).

## Esdrújula:

If the stress lies before the penultimate syllable, you always write the acute accent (in Spanish palabra esdrújula and sobreesdrújula... An example by itself. More examples: bolígrafo, pálpito, lágrima.

There you have it! That wasn’t too hard, was it?
